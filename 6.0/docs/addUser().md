The addUser() function is located in the kwitter.js file, it carries out the login process in LetsChat. The index.html page and login pages in general depend on this function (indirectly depending on the kwitter.js file). It also requires having a kwitter_room.html page/file.

This line fetches the value from the id user_name and attaches the value to the user_name variable:
```JavaScript
user_name = document.getElementById("user_name").value;
  ```
An example of how to get the user to attach a value to the id user_name which is typically done through the index.html page:
```HTML

<input type="text" name="user-field" id="user_name">

```
This line stores the user_name in the browser's local storage. By saving data in local storage, it allows the data to persist even if the browser is closed:
```JavaScript

localStorage.setItem("user_name", user_name);

```
This line redirects the user to the kwitter_room.html page, completing the login process:
```JavaScript

window.location = "kwitter_room.html";

```

After this process, the kwitter_room page should display the entered user_name value that was previously entered on the index.html login page.
