# Lets-Chat
LetsChat is a base that can be built upon in order to create a social media platform.

If you find a bug then file an Issue.

Current goals: Add more basic features out of the box so that it doesn't take extra time to implement those features in forks.

## Instructions to Implement:

1. Change the backend server with your own backend server.
2. This is made to be as customisable and easy to tweak as it can be, so tweak all you want.

This is an extended support release for the original version of LetsChat, this will not be supported forever though and it will only recieve security patches. Currently, there isn't a specific time frame for how long the support for this release will last.
